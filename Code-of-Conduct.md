# Code of Conduct
This has been taken from the [official Code of conduct documen](https://goo.gl/VsJ8q8)t.
 
**Harassment (Quick Version)**
 
Clojurians is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of Slack participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any chat topic. Participants violating these rules will be expelled from the group at the sole discretion of the group administrators.
 
 **Harassment (Less Quick Version)**
 
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption of discussions or other events, and unwelcome sexual attention.
 
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
 
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please notify a Slack administrator immediately, 
 
We expect participants to follow these rules in all discussions in our Slack channels. We think people should follow these rules outside of Slack too!
 
 **Inappropriate Language**
 
The use of profanity is heavily discouraged. Please refrain from using language that could be deemed inappropriate. We use this Google list of bad words as a guideline for inappropriate language. Participants using inappropriate language will be asked to edit messages when it happens.
