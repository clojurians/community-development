# Community Support
I've been noticing some patterns in the help that I give people on Slack/Chat. Such as:
 
* directing someone to an appropriate channel so they have a better chance of getting help
 
* creating new channels when there isn't an existing one that represents the kinds of conversations I want to have (everyone should know they have this power and maybe some advice on how best to wield it)
 
* inviting people I know to come join in on a conversation
 
* encouraging non-default avatars, whether real pictures or some identifying graphic, so that the person becomes recognized as a unique and distinctive individual
 
I think these are important and useful patterns to make sure the new system has and maybe even to optimize since they occur frequently and enhance the user experience.
 
Would also be nice to have integration with Jira to make it easier to file tickets for Clojure and ClojureScript core as the need for those often arises out of chat conversations.
 
Please add to these lists if you think of any others.
