The Clojurians Slack -- self-signup: http://clojurians.net and chat: https://clojurians.slack.com -- is the largest online community of Clojure developers right now (January 2021). Many other online communities for Clojure exist: starting with [r/Clojure on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/) and that lists most of the other popular hangouts in its right hand navigation bar (we don't duplicate them here so that we don't have to also keep a list up-to-date here!).

**The Clojurians Slack operates under this [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/clojurians/community-development/blob/master/Code-of-Conduct.md).**

We use the free plan for Slack because of the large number of active users (it would cost many thousands of dollars a month to upgrade), which means that only a few days of messages are visible/searchable. Most channels are archived to https://clojurians-log.clojureverse.org/ (and if you create a new channel on the Clojurians Slack, you can `/invite @logbot` to it in order to log messages to that site). Many channels are also archived to the [Clojurians Zulip Chat](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/) which is on the free open source plan and therefore has unlimited message visibility/searchability -- Slack channels show up as "topics" under the "slack-archive" stream (and if you create a new channel on the Clojurians Slack, you can `/invite @zulip-mirror-bot` to it in order to log messages to the Zulip chat).

**For more details see [Andy Fingerhut's write up about archiving and searching those archives](https://github.com/clojurians/community-development/blob/master/clojurians-slack-archive-notes.md).**

This repo also includes historical notes about Slack alternatives that were discussed as part of the old Hackpad documents.
