# Q&A
 
It gets old answering the same question over and over again so if we ask our questions here and folks add answers to questions then we have a single place to send everyone to see questions and answers. Cool, right?
 
**Why are we doing this? We like Slack. Why not just stay with Slack?**
 
A: Impending Slackpocalypse
 
**Can't we just pay for Slack?**
 
A: The cost is prohibitive and against the ideals of the community, which includes not excluding anyone.
 
**We don't really need archives, do we? They're nice, but not necessary.**
 
A: quote from pkobrien in the [#community](/ep/search/?q=%23community)-development slack channel "The businesses that would and could provide financial support have the greatest need for certain features like archiving of public discussion, archiving of private messages, ease of working with uploaded files (like error logs and screenshots for tech support). Since meeting their needs only improves the system to the benefit of the entire community I have no problem with making those features a priority in any evaluation."
 
They're pretty much essential for a lot of the Cursive support I do. Often, someone will describe a bug or problem and send supporting information (screenshots, logs), either privately or in the Cursive channel. They're gone in a day right now, and that time is getting shorter as the community gets busier. Right now, I either "archive" it by hand, or (more likely) forget about the problem.
 
**What about the folks who prefer IRC and are getting left out?**
 
A: ? (also, see the [IRC page]([https://github.com/clojurians/clojurians-chat/wiki/IRC](https://github.com/clojurians/clojurians-chat/wiki/IRC)))
 
**Why don't we just create a comparable UX over IRC?**
 
A: see the [IRC page]([https://github.com/clojurians/clojurians-chat/wiki/IRC](https://github.com/clojurians/clojurians-chat/wiki/IRC))
 
**What is going to be migrated if we do have to leave Slack?**
 
A: ?
 
**How much warning, if any, would Slack give us before shutting us down?**
 
A: ?
