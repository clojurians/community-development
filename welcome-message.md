Hello and welcome to the Clojurians Slack!

We want this to be a friendly and helpful space for everyone and the Admin team here tries to be very active as moderators, to keep things that way.
* If you are new to Slack and need help navigating around, _ask in #slack-help_
* If you encounter spam or any kind of harassment, _please report it in #community-development_ (or, if you do not feel comfortable posting about it in public, reach out via direct message to any of the Admins who are online -- _the list of Admins can be found in the Code of Conduct document_: see below).
* We encourage the use of threads in Slack so that back and forth discussions do not clutter up the channels, allowing multiple conversations to happen at the same time without "talking over" each other.


There are really only two **rules**:
* Jobs openings may be posted **only in the dedicated channels**: #jobs and #remote-jobs -- **recruiters take note!**
* We have a **zero** tolerance policy for spam and unsolicited direct messages of a commercial nature (especially about things like Upwork) -- violators will have their accounts deactivated!

As a reminder, Clojure communities try to follow these guidelines for general conduct -- https://www.clojure.org/community/etiquette -- and this Slack also has a specific Code of Conduct: https://github.com/clojurians/community-development/blob/master/Code-of-Conduct.md

**Why not say "Hi!" and tell folks a bit about yourself and why you're here, in #introduce-yourself!**
